{"name":"Adventures in Textia 3","tagline":"The second follow up to the text-based game Adventures in Textia. This game now features graphics and platforming.","body":"### Hi!\r\nThis is the project website for the public domain game _Adventures in Textia 3_:\r\nThis game is built using [python](http://python.org/) and the a GUI library which we will decide on\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n###Story\r\nThe story is very flexible and will adapt depending on the characters actions. This will make the game have a high level of immersion, as all your choices affect gameplay. Thsi is my vision:\r\n> If you steal something, you may lose **reputation** and not by trusted anymore for some quests. Similiar principles apply if you have done something heroic. You will be much more able to persuade people to help you, and gain advantages. If you often spend a lot of money often, you are more likely to get robbed.\r\n\r\n###Gameplay\r\nThe gameplay is text-based, but still very interesting, as it is controlled via buttons to answer questions like `The path you are walking comes to an end. What would you like to do?` and the buttons being `Continue through forest` and `Turn back`. In the background there are images related to the situation the player is in.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
