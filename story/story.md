#Adventures in Texia 2: The Lost Tower

##Story

This game is a sequel to a text-based adventure game I made with Java in Summer 2013 (Adventures in Textia). This game stars the hero from my first game who jouneys to a new land, after he defeated Drake the Duck-Dragon, to find the mysterious Lost Tower. He journeys through a vast forest until he finds a clearing where an old man in a black hood stands. This man has a quest for our hero, to find 6 special items inside the tower. Our hero leaves the forest and into a field where the Lost Tower resides. He enters the tower where his 2nd adventure begins. Inside the Lost Tower he will have journey through  its many areas to find and defeat the 6 bosses in order to complete the old man's quest and to discover the mystery of the Lost Tower.
