What to Contribute
==================
We are open to any contributions to the project. There are many areas to contribute. You could...
###Make graphics, designs, buttons and more
We need a lot of graphics to help the player's imagination along. The GUI needs to have pretty buttons, We want a medieval-looking font, nice backgrounds, maps for the players to see where they are, images and "paintings" for the GUI, which adjust based on scene. We want designs of people, to overlay with the scenery, to provide a good atmosphere. Then we also need icons and images for the weapons, armor and so forth. 
###Write and plan quests.
Plan some of the many quests available to the player. Make a flowchart, write down requirements to start the quest, dialog, and where the quest can be started.
###Work on the GUI
This game should have a GUI. It is still text based, but you can use a graphical interface and buttons to control the game. This is much more beginner-friendly and allows use of custom fonts
